# Changelog

## [4.0.0] - 2026-06-10 (unreleased, v4 / fable-refactor-1)

- Version aligned to the v4 generation; internal `@uvrn/*` peer ranges moved to `^4.0.0`.
  No behavioral changes in this package beyond the generation-wide hardening documented in
  the root CHANGELOG.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-06-09

### Changed
- **UVRN Packages v3 — canonical 23-package protocol generation.** All packages aligned to `3.0.0`; internal `@uvrn/*` peer ranges moved to `^3.0.0` so v3 packages resolve only against v3 peers. This release is the canonical source of truth and supersedes prior npm/official versions.

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
